      <h1>Movies App</h1>
      <p>
        The main objective is to build the server-side component of a “movies” web
        application. The web application will provide users with access to
        information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be
        able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of
        their favorite movies.
